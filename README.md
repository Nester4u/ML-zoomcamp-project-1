Data Analysis on Students Performance
## Project Description and Problem faced:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict studentâ€™s academic performance through data-driven insights. The Dataset was gotten from the Federal Ministry of Education in Nigeria. The Ministry aims to predict students' final grades based on their characteristics, family background, study habits, and other relevant factors. The problem faced was that the dataset was not clean and as such it was impossible to determine the final grades of the students. I cleaned the dataset properly through the techniques I have learnt, and I trained a model based on 3 different algorithms. Irrelevant columns were dropped, categorical variables were converted through encoding techniques, EDA was conducted and the model was trained, after which parameter tuning was applied and the final model was trained. I look forward to your feedback and positive reviews.
## Model:
The model was trained and tested to select the best performing algorithm for the prediction. Amongst the algorithms used were; Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree. Finally, the Linear Regression Model was selected due to its better performance.
## Instructions on how to run the Model:
-	Download the files
-	Run the file on jupyter notebook
-	Run python train.py on a terminal
-	Build the docker container
-	Run the docker container

## Dependencies
- You can easily install the dependencies and use the venv environment
