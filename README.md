Data Analysis on Students Performance
## Project Description:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict studentâ€™s academic performance through data-driven insights. The Dataset was gotten from the Federal Ministry of Education in Nigeria. The ministry aims to predict students' final grades based on their characteristics, family background, study habits, and other relevant factors.
## Model:
Different models were trained and tested to select the best performing one for the prediction. Amongst the models trained were; Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree. Finally, the Linear Regression Model was selected due to its performance.
## Instructions on how to run the Model:
-	Download the files
-	Run train.py
-	Build the docker container
-	Run the docker container
